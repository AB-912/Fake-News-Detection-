This project was made possible through a two-day offline workshop held in collaboration with faculty at IIT Bhubaneswar. The workshop provided me with a valuable opportunity to collaborate with other participants  and the faculty and apply my skills and knowledge to the development of the project. Together, we worked to create a high-quality and impactful result.


FAKE NEWS DETECTION
During this project, I developed a model that can accurately predict whether news is real or fake. The key steps I took to achieve this include:

Conducting a thorough analysis of the dataset
Removing any unnecessary rows and columns to ensure data quality
Dividing the data into training and testing sets with an 80:20 split ratio
Utilizing the CountVectorizer method for feature extraction
Implementing a random forest classifier to generate predictions
Analyzing the confusion matrix and accuracy scores to evaluate model performance.

By applying these methods and techniques, I was able to create a reliable and
effective predictive model for detecting real vs. fake news.
